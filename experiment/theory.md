In order to classifY a soil for engineering purposes, one needs to know the distribution of the size of grains in a given soil mass. Sieve analysis is a method used to deter mine the grain-size distribution of soils. Sieves are made of woven wires with square openings. Note that as the sieve number increases, the size of the openings decreases.

Soils having particles larger than 0.075mm size are termed as coarse grained soils. In these soils more than 50% of the total material by mass is larger than 75 micron. Coarse grained soils may have boulder, cobble, gravel and sand. 

The following particle classification names are given depending on the size of the particle:
1. BOULDER: Particle size is more than 300mm.
2. COBBLE: Particle size in range of 80mm to 300mm.
3. GRAVE (G): Particle size in range of 4.75mm to 80mm.
	a. Coarse Gravel: 20 to 80mm.
	b. Fine Gravel: 4.75mm to 20mm.
4. SAND (S): Particle size in range of 0.075mm to 4.75mm.
a. Coarse sand: 2.0mm to 4.75mm
b. Medium Sand: 0.075mm to 0.425mm.
c. Fine Sand: 0.075mm to o.425mm.

Name of the soil is given depending on the maximum percentage of the above components.
