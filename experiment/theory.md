Soils having particle larger than 0.075mm size are termed as coarse grained soils. In these soils more than 50% of the total material by mass is larger 75 micron. Coarse grained soil may have boulder, cobble, gravel and sand.
The following particle classification names are given depending on the size of the particle:

i. BOULDER: particle size is more than 300mm.
ii. COBBLE: particle size in range 80mm to 300mm.
iii. GRAVE (G): particle size in range 4.75mm to 80mm.
a. Coarse Gravel: 20 to 80mm.
b. Fine Gravel: 4.75mm to 20mm.
iv. SAND (S): particle size in range 0.075mm to 4.75mm.
a. Coarse sand: 2.0mm to 4.75mm
b. Medium Sand: 0.075mm to 0.425mm.
c. Fine Sand: 0.075mm to o.425mm.
