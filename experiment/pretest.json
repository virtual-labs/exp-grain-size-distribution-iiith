			"question": "1. A soil sample may be well graded if ____",
			"answers": {
				"a": "If it has most number of particles of same size",
				"b": "Excess of certain particles",
				"c": "Good representation of particles of all sizes",
				"d": "None of the above"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "This is the definition of a uniform graded soil, not a well graded soil.",
				"b": "More fit to be called uniform graded soil instead of well graded in this case.",
				"c": "",
				"d": "One of the other options does contain the correct definition of a well graded soil."
			},
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"correctAnswer": "c"
		},
		{
			"question": "2. The particle size distribution curves are extremely useful for the classification of which of the following?",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Fine grained soils",
				"b": "Coarse grained soils",
				"c": "Silts and clays",
				"d": "Both a and b"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "While these soils can be classified using the curves, this is not the completely right answer.",
				"b": "While these soils can be classified using the curves, this is not the completely right answer.",
				"c": "Silts and clays are difficult to sieve and usually end up giving a uniform graded type distribution which makes it hard to classify them by this method.",
				"d": ""
			},
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"correctAnswer": "d"
		},
		{
			"question": "3. The shape of the particle size curve, which is represented by the coefficient of curvature (Cc), is given by ____",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Cc = D<sub>30</sub><sup>2</sup> / (D<sub>10</sub> * D<sub>40</sub>)",
				"b": "Cc = D<sub>40</sub><sup>2</sup> / (D<sub>10</sub> * D<sub>30</sub>)",
				"c": "Cc = D<sub>30</sub><sup>2</sup> / (D<sub>10</sub> * D<sub>60</sub>)",
				"d": "Cc = D<sub>60</sub> / D<sub>10</sub>"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "",
				"b": "",
				"c": "The coefficient of curvature (Cc) is given by the equation Cc = D30<sup>2</sup> / (D<sub>10</sub> * D<sub>60</sub>).",
				"d": "This is the formula for the coefficient of uniformity, not of curvature."
			},

			"correctAnswer": "c"

		{
			"question": "4. The coefficient of uniformity (CV) is the ratio of ___",
			"answers": {
				"a": "D<sub>60</sub> and D<sub>10</sub>",
				"b": "D<sub>30</sub> and D<sub>10</sub>",
				"c": "D<sub>10</sub> and D<sub>30</sub>",
				"d": "D<sub>10</sub> and D<sub>60</sub>"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "The coefficient of uniformity CV, is defined as the ratio of D<sub>60</sub> and D<sub>10</sub>, i.e., CV = D<sub>60</sub> / D<sub>10</sub>.",

			"question": "5. Laboratory sieve analysis was carried out on a soil sample using a complete set of standard IS sieves. Out of 500g of soil used in the test, 200g was retained on IS 600 Mu sieve, 250g was retained on IS 500 Mu sieve and the remaining 50g was retained on IS 425 sieve. Determine the coefficient of uniformity.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "0.9",
				"b": "1",
				"c": "1.1",
				"d": "1.2"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "",
				"b": "",
				"c": "",
				"d": "If we tabulate the data including the derived values such as the percent passing for each sieve, we find that exactly 60% soil is finer than 600 Mu sieve and 10% for 500 Mu. Using this, we can directly apply the formula D<sub>60</sub> / D<sub>10</sub>."
