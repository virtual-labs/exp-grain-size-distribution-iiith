				"a": "Coefficient of uniformity, D<sub>60</sub> Particle size in mm such that 60% of the soil is finer than this size. D<sub>10</sub> Particle size in mm such that 10% of the soil is finer than this size. For uniformly graded soil, is nearly 1 For a well graded gravel, For a well graded sand, Therefore, the soil having a uniformity coefficient smaller than about 2 is considered uniform. For a well graded gravel, cu >4 For a well graded sand, Cu >6",
